# Class Presentation 

Hello everyone, My name is Bingying Liang. It's a pleasure to be here to discuss a topic about The Gateway to the Future of Cybersecurity: Quantum Communication. This isn't just a concept of the future; it's a revolutionary approach reshaping the landscape of cybersecurity today."



Now I want to introduce quantum communication first. "Quantum communication represents the backbone of the ==burgeoning== quantum internet. It's not just a theoretical concept; it's a practical technology offering mathematically perfect security. In China, it has already conducted a lot of experiments to verify quantum communication. Compared with the classical communication methods, quantum communication can almost ensure 100% security.



Let's talk about the fundamental principles.

First is the Superposition, I think lots of people have already heard of ==Schr√∂dinger's== Cat or seen this picture before. This is a box, now we have a cat inside. Before we open the box we can not make sure the cat is dead or alive, which means this cat can represent two different situations. Dead and alive at the same time. This is superposition meaning. One thing can represent two things. Compared with classical computers, 1 bit can represent one or 0. But in quantum computers, one qubit can represent 1 and 0 at the same time. 



Second is the Entanglement. Entanglement, a phenomenon Einstein famously called 'spooky action at a distance,' links particles in such a way that the state of one immediately influences the other, regardless of the distance between them.  For example, here is a pair of Entangled Photons, one blue, and another one red. If the first one is red, then the second one is always blue. If the first one is blue, then the second one must be red. Their results influence each other. If someone eavesdrops, it will make the photon color come out too early, and then another photon can be detected as being eavesdropped by other people.



These principles form the basis of Quantum Key Distribution, a method ensuring secure communication by detecting any form of eavesdropping due to the nature of quantum states." 





For now, quantum still is in research and hasn't been used in commercials. 

But advantages, Quantum communication brings huge advantages in cybersecurity, particularly in detecting eavesdropping attempts. 

A notable application is in Quantum Satellites, which can ensure the security of communication over vast distances. 

Even there are lots of technology challenges we are facing now, such as limitations in long-distance quantum communication and the high costs and complexity of the technology. 

The potential of quantum communication is vast. When the classical Internet or computers came out, the whole world was quite different than before. So who can know when quantum time comes? But for now, that's closer to reality than ever before. We are on the way to the future now.



This is my reference for my presentation.

Thank you for listening.
